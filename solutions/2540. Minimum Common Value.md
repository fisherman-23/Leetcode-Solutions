Leetcode 2540. Minimum Common Value

This is an easy question, and my first thought was to utilize a two pointer method, incrementing whichever yields a lower value in the array, returning if its the same 

```python
class Solution(object):
    def getCommon(self, arr1, arr2):
        # make sure both list are sorted in ascending order
        left = 0
        right = 0
        lenLeft = len(arr1)
        lenRight = len(arr2)
        while left < lenLeft and right < lenRight:
            leftValue = arr1[left]
            rightValue = arr2[right]
            if leftValue < rightValue:
                left  += 1
            elif leftValue > rightValue:
                right += 1
            else:
                return leftValue

        return -1
        
# Time & Space complexity of O(n+m) and O(1) respectively 
```
