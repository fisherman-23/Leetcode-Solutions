Leetcode 11. Container With Most Water

My Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        area  = 0
        for i in range(0,len(height)):
            for a in range(i+1, len(height)):
                if height[i] > height[a]:
                    maxHeight = height[a]
                elif height[i] == height[a]:
                    maxHeight = height[i]
                else:
                    maxHeight = height[i]
                temp = maxHeight * (a-i)
                if temp > area:
                    area = temp

        return area

#this solution iterates through all possible combinations, giving it O(n^2) solution
#though it passed all test cases, it often runs out of time 
```

After consulting the solutions, decide to utilise two-pointers method to solve.

```python
class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        leftPointer = 0
        rightPointer = len(height)-1
        area = 0
        while leftPointer < rightPointer:
            maxHeight = min([height[leftPointer],height[rightPointer]])
            length = rightPointer - leftPointer
            area = max(area,maxHeight*length)
            # move the pointer which ever will give a larger value
            if height[leftPointer]>height[rightPointer]:
                rightPointer -=1
            else:
                leftPointer +=1
            
        return area

# decides which pointer to move in order to give the next best possible answer
# this did not time out
# this has a time complexity of O(N)

# what happens if both left and right values are the same? then what do we increment?
# does not matter, because regardless, you will be getting a smaller value
# eg: 3 and 3, if increment the right and becomes 5, height will still be limited to 3
# thus the area actually decreases because length decreases from the increment
```

Takeaway:
Two-pointer method, usually N^2 methods and above would time out and should not be used during interviews

instead of doing if else statements to compare values and update, can use max
