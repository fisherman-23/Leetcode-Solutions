Leetcode 14. Longest Common Prefix

My Solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def longestCommonPrefix(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        store = '' 
        count = 0
        minSize = len(min(strs,key=len))
        while count < minSize:
            c = strs[0][count]
            for i in strs:
                if i[count] == c:
                    continue
                else:
                    return store
            store += c
            count+=1

        return store

# the time complexity is O(nm)
# space complexity of O(n)
```

my idea is to use the list to take down all similar chars one by one until the smallest word or until hit a difference
