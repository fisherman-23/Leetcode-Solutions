Leetcode 13. Roman to Integer

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        total = 0
        store = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100,'D':500,'M':1000}
        niche = {'IV':4,'IX':9,'XL':40,'XC':90,'CD':400,'CM':900}
        for i in niche:
            total += s.count(i)*niche[i]
            s = s.replace(i,"",s.count(i))
        for i in s:
            total += store[i]
        return total

# this has a time complexity of O(N)
```

In this leetcode, my solution was actually quite close to the model solution

this solution utilises a map also, but it first replaces all the IV, IX, etc to the roman representation of IIII, VIIIII, thus, no need to go through extra step of checking them before counting and replacing

another solution involes more fundamentals, less using functions like replace and count

It uses two cases,

1. is if the current character pointed to has more value compared to the next, in the roman system, this means that these two characters are unrelated, and can be counted normally → count += m[i]

2. is if the current character pointed to has less value compared to the next, this means that the two characters are related → count -= m[i] + m[i+1]
