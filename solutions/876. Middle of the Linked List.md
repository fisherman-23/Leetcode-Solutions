Leetcode 876. Middle of the Linked List

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution(object):
    def middleNode(self, head):
        length = 0
        itr = head
        while itr != None:
            length +=1
            itr = itr.next
        middleIndex = length//2
        # since index from 0, no need to add 1

        itr = head
        count = 0

        while itr != None:
            if count == middleIndex:
                return itr

            itr = itr.next
            count += 1
```

basic refresher for linked list concepts

learnt that there is another one pass method that uses pointers â†’ using fast and slow pointers

fast pointer will iterate two steps while slow will iterate one. By the time the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle,

```python
    def middleNode(self, head):
        fast = head
        slow = head
        while fast and fast.next: #this work since it check fast first and breaks without checking fast.next which will throw an error as None has no value next
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return slow

```
