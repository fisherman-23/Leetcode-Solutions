Leetcode 136. Single Number

My solution:

my first solution utilises a brute force approach where i iterate through every single element and using the count function check if there is duplicates

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        setNums = set(nums)
        for i in setNums:
            if nums.count(i) == 1:
                return i

# time complexity of O(n^2)
```

This is my second try, utilising sorting, and comparing of adjacent elements

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        p1 = 0
        p2 = 1
        while p2 < len(nums):
            if nums[p1] != nums[p2]:
                return nums[p1]
            else:
                p1 += 2
                p2 += 2
        return nums[-1]

# sorting has time complexity of O(nlogn)
# while loop to check has time complexity of O(N)
# taking the worst case, this algorithm has a time complexity of O(nlogn)
```

Third solution, after looking at concepts from the solutions page, i decided to use a dictionary, since accessing and inputting data into a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNumber(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        data = {}
        for i in range(0,len(nums)):
            data[nums[i]] = data.get(nums[i],0) + 1
        for i,k in data.items():
            if k == 1:
                return i

# this is a O(N) solution 
```
