Leetcode 206. Reversed Linked List

my first attempt after freshly learning singly linked list

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        store = []
        itr = head
        while itr:
            store.append(itr.val)
            itr = itr.next
        store.reverse()
        count = 0
        itr = head
        while itr:
            itr.val = store[count]
            itr = itr.next
            count +=1
        return head

# very inefficient, extracted data out of linkedlist to array just to reverse
```

after watching neetcodeio, there are two possible solutions

1) using an iterative approach

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
        previous, current = None, head 
        while current:
            nxt = current.next 
            current.next = previous 
            previous = current 
            current = nxt 
        return previous

# this uses two pointer, to go through all the nodes, doing current.next = previous
# time complexity O(N)
# space complexity O(1), because only using pointers, only have 3 var changing
```
