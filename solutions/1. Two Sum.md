Leetcode 1. Two Sum

```python
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # initialise hashmap
        keyValuePair = {}
        t=0
        for i in nums:
            temp = target - i #temp represents the number we need to find
            index = keyValuePair.get(temp) 
            if index == None:
                keyValuePair.update({i:t})
            else:
                return [index,t]
            t+=1
```

uses the concept of hashmaps, which has O(1), combined with a for loop with O(N), to make this solution O(N), instead of the common one which uses two for loops to go through every single combinations. O(N^2)
