Leetcode 231. Power of Two

My original code:

```python
class Solution:

    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        if n <= 0:
            return False
        count = 0 
        while True:
            if n % 2 == 0:
                n = n/2
            else:
                if n == 1:
                    count +=1
                    break
                n =(n/2)- 0.5
                count +=1
        if count == 1:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

My solutions basically uses the concept of a numbers binary value

A number whicih is power of two, always has exactly one ‘1’ value in binary

eg: 16, which is a power of two is 10000

eg: 25, not power of two, has 11001

while this concept is efficient by itself, my implementation of it is not, below is the improved one liner more efficient code

```python
class Solution:

    def isPowerOfTwo(self, n: int) -> bool:
        return n and not(n&n-1)
```

**how this works is as follows:**

if n is indeed a power of two, it will look like this with only one bit with ‘1’

010000

if we subtract 1 from the number, it will look like

0011111

therefore,

using the formula n & n-1, this will always return 0 if number is power of two

since 010000 & 0011111 = 000000

Takeaway: 

bitwise operators in Python
