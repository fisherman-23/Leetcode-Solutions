Leetcode 48. Rotate Image

Some planning before i start, from pattern recognition. 

Step by step how to find out where element goes

1) find n, in the n x n matrix

2) now we know that the most outer elements, will shift n-1 move in clockwise direction

3) the next subsequent ‘ring’, element will shift (n-1)-2 in clockwise direction

functions:

1) function that that takes in a value and shift by that amount (clockwise)

2) function that determines which ‘ring’ the element is in
